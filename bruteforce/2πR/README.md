### 2πR
Given all the references to the word Circumference, I had the idea to apply the formula for calculating the circumference of a circle to the gematria:
`round(2*π*R) % 29`
Two attempts were made, with the value of `R` being either the gematria index of each rune or the gematria prime associated with each rune.
I did not find anything interesting in the results unfortunately.

You can view the results in the `pages_2piR.txt` and `pages_2piR_primes.txt` of this directory, respectively.

*Caveats & related things to try*
- This should be tried with the pages atbashed first or the reverse gematria
